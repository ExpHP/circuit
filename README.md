# `circuit`

This repository holds a little side project which may or may not become anything worthwhile. It can compute currents along a circuit.

An as-of-yet unnamed graph library is being designed together with it.  The API is currently very sparse (as things are only added when I need them).

# Dependencies

`igraph` is currently a dependency, but it is sorely underutilized, to the point where it might as well be ripped out.
