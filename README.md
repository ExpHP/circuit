# `circuit`

This repository holds a little side project which may or may not become anything worthwhile. It can compute currents along a circuit.

# Dependencies

* `networkx`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`

Also, the vast majority of the code targets `python3`.
There are currently no plans to support `python2`.
In the ubuntu Trusty Tahr repositories, you will find packages prefixed with `python3` (e.g. `python3-networkx`).
Or if you prefer using Pip to install python modules, try `pip3 install`.
